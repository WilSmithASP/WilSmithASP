# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm [Your Name]

I'm a full-stack software engineer with experience building reliable, scalable applications across the stack â€” from designing backend APIs to crafting responsive UIs. I currently work at Spectrum, where I maintain and enhance large-scale financial systems used for revenue tracking, journal entry workflows, and accounting automation.

Iâ€™m most comfortable working in JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and Python, and enjoy building thoughtful tools that simplify real-world problems. My recent work spans modernizing internal platforms, eliminating vendor dependencies, and optimizing multi-million-dollar revenue pipelines â€” always with an eye on security, performance, and maintainability.
